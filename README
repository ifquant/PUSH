PUSH - A fast C implementation of the genetic programming language PUSH

This PUSH implementation is written in pure C (except Python wrapper) and uses
GLib for Code lists and Stacks (also for Hashtables and some other things).

Performance (tested on AMD 64 Athlon 3500 + AMD Athlon(tm) 64 Processor 3500+):
About 1 million PUSH instructions per second

Program exchange format:
This PUSH implementation uses XML to store and load interpreter states.

Python:
push.py includes classes Interpreter, Process and VM, where Interpreter is a
basic wrapper of the C interfaces with automatic value conversion and Process
and VM build a simple virtual machine where multiple PUSH programs can be run
at once.
